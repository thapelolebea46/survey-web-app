📝 Lifestyle Survey Application

📌 Overview

This project was created as part of a practical assessment for an internship opportunity.

The goal is to demonstrate the ability to build a full-stack application that handles user input, data storage, and basic data analysis. 

Deployment is not required — the project is intended to be run and tested locally.


The application is designed to collect survey data about people's lifestyle preferences.

It features a user interface for data entry, a database for persistent storage, and logic for analyzing the collected data.

💡 Features

🗃 Data Storage – Uses MongoDB to persist survey responses

📊 Data Analysis – Calculates average age, food preferences, and ratings


⚙️ Technologies Used

Backend: Node.js with Express.js

Database: MongoDB
